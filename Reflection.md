# MediTrack Requirements Reflection

## Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Balancing the needs of diverse stakeholders in the MediTrack project presented had challenges:

1.  **Conflicting Priorities:**
    * Patients prioritize ease of use and data privacy, while pharmacists require strict verification and stock management. These different priorities sometimes led to trade-offs in design decisions.
2.  **Regulatory Compliance:**
    * Ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations added complexity to the requirements. Meeting these standards required careful consideration of security and data privacy.
3.  **Technical Feasibility:**
    * Balancing stakeholder desires with technical limitations was challenging. Some desired features, while beneficial, required significant development effort or had scalability concerns.
4.  **Usability vs. Functionality:**
    * Striking a balance between a user-friendly interface and robust functionality was crucial. Overly complex features could overwhelm users, while overly simply designs might lack necessary capabilities.
5.  **Scalability and Performance:**
    * Ensuring the system could handle a large number of users while maintaining performance was a key consideration. This required careful planning and architectural decisions.
6. **Data Security:**
    * Ensuring all stakeholders that their data would be secure, and that the system was built with security as a priority was a challenge.

To address these challenges, I employed the following strategies:

* **Prioritization:** Used stakeholder analysis to prioritize requirements based on impact and feasibility.
* **Iterative Development:** Planned for iterative development to allow for feedback and adjustments.
* **Clear Communication:** Maintained open communication with stakeholders to ensure alignment.
* **Thorough Testing:** Planned extensive testing to ensure usability, performance, and security.

Despite these challenges, the process of defining requirements provided valuable insights into the MediTrack system and its potential impact.


##   Challenges in Translating Requirements to Use Cases/Tests

Translating requirements to use cases and test cases for the MediTrack system presented several challenges:

1.**Abstraction Level:**
- Functional requirements describe what the system should do, while use cases describe how users interact with the system to achieve those goals. Bridging this gap required careful consideration to ensure that use cases adequately covered all functional requirements.
2.  **Granularity of Use Cases:**
- Determining the appropriate level of detail for use cases was challenging. Use cases needed to be detailed enough to guide development and testing but not so granular that they became overly complex.
3.  **Identifying Actors and Their Boundaries:**
- Accurately identifying all relevant actors and defining their roles and responsibilities was crucial. It was important to ensure that all stakeholders were represented and that their interactions with the system were clearly defined.
4. **Handling Alternative Flows and Exceptions:**
- Specifying all possible alternative flows and exceptions for each use case required thorough analysis. It was challenging to anticipate every potential scenario and ensure that the system would handle them appropriately.
5.  **Test Case Coverage:**
- Developing test cases that provided comprehensive coverage of all functional and non-functional requirements was a significant challenge. It was important to design test cases that were effective in validating the system's behavior and identifying potential defects.
6.  **Prioritization:**
- Deciding which use cases and test cases to prioritize was challenging, especially given resource constraints. It was important to focus on the most critical aspects of the system and ensure that they were thoroughly tested.
7.  **Ensuring Traceability:**
- Maintaining traceability between requirements, use cases, and test cases was essential for ensuring that all requirements were implemented and tested. It was challenging to establish and maintain these links throughout the development process.

## To address these challenges, I employed the following strategies:

**Iterative Approach:**
- I used an iterative approach, starting with a high-level overview and gradually adding more detail. This allowed me to refine the use cases and test cases over time and ensure that they were aligned with the requirements.
  
**Stakeholder Involvement:**
- I involved stakeholders in the process to validate the use cases and test cases and ensure that they accurately reflected their needs and expectations.
  
**Use Case Templates and Checklists:**
- I used use case templates and checklists to ensure that all necessary information was included and that the use cases were complete and consistent.
  
**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Principles:**
- I applied TDD principles to guide the development of test cases, writing test cases before implementing the corresponding functionality.
  
**Regular Reviews:**
- I conducted regular reviews of the use cases and test cases to identify any gaps or inconsistencies and ensure that they were of high quality.

-Overall, the process of translating requirements to use cases and test cases was a valuable learning experience. It highlighted the importance of careful analysis, clear communication, and a systematic approach to software development.
