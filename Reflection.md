# MediTrack Requirements Reflection

## Challenges in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

Balancing the needs of diverse stakeholders in the MediTrack project presented several challenges:

1.  **Conflicting Priorities:**
    * Patients prioritize ease of use and data privacy, while pharmacists require stringent verification and stock management. These differing priorities sometimes led to trade-offs in design decisions.
2.  **Regulatory Compliance:**
    * Ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR) added complexity to the requirements. Meeting these standards required careful consideration of security and data privacy.
3.  **Technical Feasibility:**
    * Balancing stakeholder desires with technical limitations was challenging. Some desired features, while beneficial, required significant development effort or had scalability concerns.
4.  **Usability vs. Functionality:**
    * Striking a balance between a user-friendly interface and robust functionality was crucial. Overly complex features could overwhelm users, while overly simplistic designs might lack necessary capabilities.
5.  **Scalability and Performance:**
    * Ensuring the system could handle a large number of users while maintaining performance was a key consideration. This required careful planning and architectural decisions.
6. **Data Security:**
    * Ensuring all stakeholders that their data would be secure, and that the system was built with security as a priority was a challenge.

To address these challenges, I employed the following strategies:

* **Prioritization:** Used stakeholder analysis to prioritize requirements based on impact and feasibility.
* **Iterative Development:** Planned for iterative development to allow for feedback and adjustments.
* **Clear Communication:** Maintained open communication with stakeholders to ensure alignment.
* **Thorough Testing:** Planned extensive testing to ensure usability, performance, and security.

Despite these challenges, the process of eliciting and defining requirements provided valuable insights into the MediTrack system and its potential impact.
