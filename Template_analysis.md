| **Basic Kanban**     | To Do → In Progress → Done                                 | Manual movement of tasks                                    | Suitable for simple Agile tracking but lacks automation for large teams. |
| **Automated Kanban** | Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done                       | Issues auto-move when PRs are opened, closed, or merged      | Good for Agile as it streamlines task management and provides automation for smoother workflows. |
| **Bug Triage**       | New Issues → Needs Triage → High Priority → In Progress → Done | Automatically labels and assigns issues                      | Useful for managing bug fixes but lacks features for full Agile project development. |
| **Team Planning**    | Icebox → Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done             | Automates backlog prioritization and team assignments        | Ideal for Agile as it supports backlog grooming, sprint planning, and team collaboration. |

## **Justification:**
For the MediTrack project, the best-fit GitHub project template is the Automated Kanban:

Automated Kanban: This template is highly suitable for Agile methodologies as it provides streamlined task management through automated progress tracking. As issues progress through the workflow (Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done), automation removes the need for manual task movement, which saves time and reduces the chance of errors in task tracking. This will be especially useful for MediTrack's fast-paced development environment where tasks need to be tracked efficiently across different stages.
