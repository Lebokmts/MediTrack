# MediTrack System Specification

## 1. Introduction

* **Project Title:** MediTrack
* **Domain:** Healthcare, specifically medication management and prescription digitization.
* **Domain Description:** The healthcare domain is focused on providing medical services and products to maintain and improve health. This project targets the medication management aspect, aiming to reduce errors, improve patient adherence, and enhance security in prescription handling. It includes electronic prescription storage, medication reminders, and prescription verification. This system will be deployed to pharmacies and patients.
* **Problem Statement:**
    * Traditional paper prescriptions are prone to loss, damage, and fraud.
    * Patients often forget to take their medications on time.
    * Pharmacists face challenges in verifying prescription authenticity.
    * Pharmacies struggle to track medication stock levels efficiently.
    * The lack of a centralized digital system leads to inefficiencies and potential safety risks in medication management.
* **Individual Scope:**
    * This project will focus on developing a functional mobile application and a secure backend system.
    * The system will include core features such as digital prescription storage, medication reminders, QR code verification, and basic stock level tracking.
    * The scope will be limited to the core functionality of the system, and will not include advanced features like integrated payment systems or in-depth inventory management in this initial phase.
    * The system will be made to be scalable, so that more features can be added in the future.
    * The project will focus on the mobile application and the backend api, and database. The project will not create the external databases that the system interacts with.
* **Technologies:**
    * **Mobile Application:** React Native (for cross-platform development) or native Android/iOS development (Kotlin/Swift).
    * **Backend API:** Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django.
    * **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    * **Notification Service:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).
    * **QR Code Scanning:** Libraries provided by the mobile development framework.
    * **Cloud Hosting:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure.
