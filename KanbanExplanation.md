# Kanban Board Explanation for MediTrack

## What is a Kanban Board?

A **Kanban board** is a visual project management tool that helps teams visualize their workflow. It tracks tasks through different stages such as **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. By creating a clear visual representation of the tasks, it enables team members to focus on the work at hand, identify bottlenecks, and improve overall productivity.

## How the Kanban Board Supports Agile Principles

- **Visualizes Workflow**: The board represents each task's progress from **To Do** to **Done**, with columns representing different stages of the workflow (e.g., Testing, Blocked).
  
- **Limits Work-in-Progress (WIP)**: To avoid bottlenecks and ensure the team is not overloaded, we limit the **number of tasks** in each column (WIP limits).
  
- **Supports Agile Principles**: 
   - **Continuous Delivery**: Tasks flow smoothly through the board, supporting frequent and timely delivery of small chunks of work.
   - **Adaptability**: The Kanban board allows the team to adjust task priorities, add new columns, and change workflows as the project evolves.
