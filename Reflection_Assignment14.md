# Reflection – Assignment 14: Peer Review and Open Source Collaboration

Assignment 14 was an interesting and valuable experience because it focused on preparing my MediTrack project for public collaboration and peer review. Unlike the previous assignments, this one was not just about coding or testing, but also about building an open-source-friendly environment. It helped me see what it takes to make a software project accessible, understandable, and ready for contributions from other developers.

One of the key tasks was to prepare the repository with the correct structure and documentation. I created important files like `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `LICENSE`. Each of these plays a specific role. The README helps new users understand the project quickly. The CONTRIBUTING file gives clear steps on how to get started, how to set up the environment, and how to submit changes. The ROADMAP shows the future goals of the project, and the LICENSE file legally allows others to use and contribute to the code. Creating these files helped me think more about the people who might use or join my project in the future.

Another part of the assignment was labeling GitHub issues to guide contributors. I created good first issues and feature requests to give new contributors something easy and clear to start with. This is very important in open source because it makes the project more welcoming. It also helps maintainers prioritize what features or bugs should be worked on next.

The peer voting section was something I hadn’t done before. It helped me get feedback on which issues and pull requests other people thought were important. I created a `VOTING_RESULTS.md` file to summarize the votes. This made me feel like the project was becoming more of a team effort rather than a solo task. It also helped me see how other developers think about features, bugs, and improvements.

I also had to choose a license. I selected the MIT License because it is very common, easy to understand, and allows people to use the code freely. Adding this made the project more professional and ready for public use.

Overall, Assignment 14 helped me shift from thinking like a student to thinking like a project maintainer. It showed me that writing code is only part of the job. Communication, documentation, and collaboration are just as important, especially in open source. I learned that good projects are not only functional but also easy to understand, test, and contribute to.

I now feel more confident that if someone wanted to join the MediTrack project, they would find it easy to get started. They would see a clear README, know how to set up the project, find an issue to work on, and follow a process to submit their changes.

In the end, Assignment 14 helped me understand what it really means to be open source. It taught me how to make my work accessible and inclusive, and it gave me useful tools that I can use in future projects and real-world software development.
